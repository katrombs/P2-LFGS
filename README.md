# Running the Program from CLI
### Steps:
1. In the cmd window, head to the base directory of the `src` folder.
2. Type in `javac Main.java` to compile the Java project.
3. To run the project, type in `java Main.java`.
4. Follow the steps in the program to run it.

### Note:
- Currently, the main display is bugged, so only the basic display of each dungeon's status, the number of parties that have completed their dungeon runs in that dungeon, and the total runtime of the dungeon after it has finished executing is shown on the CLI.
